# Python project in a mock terminal for Code Institute

## General information

This is a project for a course in Python, Project Portfolio 3, for Code Institute by Gustaf Starh√∂g.
The purpose of this project is to promote myself and show my skills in Python.

This project is a budget application that runs in a mock terminal in Heroku where you get to do the following things:
1. Create an account and a pincode.
2. Enter different expenses and their costs.
3. See your budget with calculations showing how much you have left to spend in total & per day of the remaining days of the month.
4. You can at anytime delete any data, or your entire account if you chose.

Disclaimer: I could not get the pyfiglet print to look the way I wanted it in the deployed terminal. I tried different fonts, sizes, widths and printing the words one by one on different lines without success. This is how it looks in the terminal on Gitpod:

## UX
The UX is very limited due to the program running inside the mock terminal. However, some colors and icons were used to highlight certain information throughout the program to make it a little more pleasing to see and engage with.
The welcome message in the start of the program was used with pyfiglet, and although I did not manage to make it look the same on Heroku as in the gitpod terminal, I decided to leave it in the program.

## Flowchart
In planning this project I started out with making a flowchart for what I wanted the project to contain. When making the project this was very helpfull on knowing where to start and what I needed to do.

I first made a flowchart in Lucidchart, however, I was not able to open it later again, even though it was visible in my account. So I created a new flowchart using https://miro.com/.

## General features
- I thought of making a budget application due to the economic instability in the world right now. I wanted to make a simple budget app that works and shows how much you would have left after your expenses each month. 
- The budget app is linked with two google sheets through an API. 
    - The account name and pincode are saved together in a google sheet. 
    - The pincode is encrypted when saved to the google sheet. 
- In the data sheet, the following data is saved:
    - Account Name
    - Budget Month
    - Total Budget
    - Expense name
    - Expense amount
    - Transition type(Debit or Credit)
    - Todays date
    - Selected expense category(ex, Household or Transportation)
- If the user is a returning user and enters a new total budget amount, that amount will be the one used to do all calculations. I wanted the latest input of Total budget to be the one to use because there might be a change in the income since last time.
---
### Welcome section
- When you start the program you are greeted with a pyfiglet print that says "Your budget app!".
- You are prompted to enter an Account name. If you are a returning user, you can choose your old Account name. If you are a new user, you can enter your Account name. If the Account name already exists, you will be told and you have the chance to restart and try another name. 
- If you are a returning user you enter your pincode, that is then matched against the google sheet's saved pincode and decrypts it and you can proceed.
- If you are a new user you must choose a pincode before proceeding. 
- If you enter a wrong pincode 3 times, the program shuts down as a precaution against bots trying to hack the pincode.

### Total budget and month for the budget
- After your account has either been matched or created, you will see the options you have to choose from. You can either:
    - Add new data
    - Display old saved data
    - Delete data and/or your account
    - Exit the program
Depending on your choice different things will happen.

### Adding new data:
- If you choose to add new data, the following inputs must be filled:
    - Month for the budget(You can only choose from the month you are currently in, or the next month. For example: "May" or "June")
    - Your total budget (For example "1000")
    - The expense type 1-5
        - 1 = Household
        - 2 = Food
        - 3 = Transportation
        - 4 = Other
        - 5 = Savings
    - The expense name (For example: Carpet)
    - Transaction type (Debit or Credit)
- After all of these inputs have been correctly filled, you can choose to enter more expenses if you want, or to proceed. If you choose to enter a new expense, the same inputs will be prompted until you don't want to add any more. 
- If you choose to not enter any more expenses, you can choose to either see your calculated budget for one of the valid months, or to exit the program.

### Viewing your budget. 
- When you choose to see your budget, you can choose from one of the 2 valid months (This or the next month).
- You will then see your Total budget and all expenses grouped together by expense type. The total budget used for the calulations, is the latest entered by the user.
- You will see how much money you have left in total, calulation in if you have paid anything by credit, that you need to save that money until the end of the month to afford the credit payment. 
- You will also see how much money you have to spend for each day that remains of the month. Therefore if you do your budget the 1st of the month, you will get a different result than if you do it on the 20th. 
- After you have viewed your budget, you can choose to either see the options again, or to exit the program.

## Testing
- I have tested all inputs to make sure that only the desired inputs are allowed to be input by the user. 
- All testing printscreens can be found [here](https://github.com/gStarhigh/pro3/tree/main/documentation/testing)

### Account name
- If you are a new user and creates an account that does not exist, you can choose your pincode and your account is correctly saved to the google sheet.

    <img src="documentation/testing/budget_accounts.png">
    </details>

### Pincode
- The pincode is saved with a different salt each time. Which means that if someone was to be able to crack the pincode of one user, it would not mean that all pincodes are leaked.
- The user has 3 tries to enter their pincode. Only 4 numbers are allowed, any other input will result in an error, and show the remaining tries.

### Options
- The options for the program contains 4 different choices for the user, Add, Display, Delete or Exit.
- Any other input from the user will result in an error until the user enters valid information.

### Transaction type
- The transaction type the user can choose is either "Debit" or "Credit". Depending on what the user has paid with, the calculations for the remaining of the budget differs as the user must save enough money to the end of the month to afford to pay the credit bill. 
- Any other input will result in an error.
<details>

### Delete data
- The user has the option to delete an entire month, if they so choose. They can only delete data in the valid months span. After the program has looped through and checked the google sheet for data for the specific month, it will display the amount of rows that were deleted. Depending of the amount of rows that the user has in the specific month, the number of rows deleted will differ.

## Deployment
Creating the Heroku app

Steps (It's very important that these steps are followed in the correct order):
1.	Create an account on https://id.heroku.com/login
2.	If you have inputs in your code, you must insert the new line code for each input at the end for the mock terminal to display your inputs correctly. The code is ‚Äú\n‚Äù.
3.	You need to enter information to your credentials.txt file, as Heroku uses this file to seach for dependencies when building your application in the mock terminal. You need to enter the following command in the command terminal: ‚Äúpip3 freeze > requirements.txt‚Äù Be sure to spell the command exactly like this, and make sure that the requirements.txt file is named the same way. 
4.	Make sure to commit and push theses changes before moving on.
5.	Go to Heroku‚Äôs daschboard.
6.	Click ‚ÄúCreate a new app‚Äù
7.	Name your app (The app‚Äôs name must be unique) and choose a region
8.	Click Create app
9.	Go to the Settings tab when the app has been created.
10.	Go to the ‚ÄúConfig Vars‚Äù (Click Reveal config vars)
11.	If you have protected any files in the gitignore file in your project we need to add config var settings for them to work(I have a file named creds.json file, I will add that one now). If you have a Google sheet API for example, follow these steps:
12.	In the field named ‚ÄúKEY‚Äù ‚Äì enter ‚ÄúCREDS‚Äù (All capital letters) Then go into your creds.json file and copy the entire content. 
13.	Paste the copied content into the field named ‚Äúvalue‚Äù
14.	Add a second KEY called ‚ÄúPORT‚Äù with the value ‚Äú8000‚Äù.
15.	Next we need to scroll down to the buildpacks and click ‚ÄúAdd buildpack‚Äù
16.	Click ‚Äúpython‚Äù, and click Save Changes. 
17.	Next we need to add another buildpack called ‚Äúnode.js‚Äù, click it, and then click Save Changes.
18.	Make sure that you do it in this order and the python buildpack is above the nodejs buildpack in the order. If they are in a different order, you can move python to the top after you have chosen both. 
19.	Click the ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù section at the top next to the settings tab. 
20.	In the deployment method, select ‚ÄúGitHub‚Äù
21.	Confirm that you want to connect to GitHub, and enter your GitHub credentials(‚ÄúIf needed‚Äù).
22.	Now you can search for your repository that you want to deploy. 
23.	Enter your repositorys name and click ‚Äúsearch‚Äù
24.	Then choose your repository and click connect
25.	Now you have 2 options, Automatic deploys, or Manually deploy.
26.	If you choose the automatic deploy, the code will automatically update each time you push to GitHub. Choose this option if your code is not yet finished. Otherwise you can choose Manual deploy, and click ‚Äúdeploy branch‚Äù
27.	When it‚Äôs done, you should see a message that says ‚ÄúYour app was successfully deployed‚Äù and you can click ‚Äúview‚Äù to see your deployed app in the mock terminal. 
28.	You are all done and your project should now be uploaded to Heroku.

## Github Pages
- This project was developed using Gitpod which I used to commit and push to GitHub using the terminal in GitPod.(Note that this project was deployed to Heroku and that those steps also must be followed.)
### Here are the steps to deploy a website to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository:

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
- At the top of the Repository, locate the Settings button on the menu.
- Under Source, click the dropdown called None and select Main Branch.
- The page will refresh automatically and generate a link to your website.
### Forking the GitHub Repository
- By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
- At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
- You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
### Making a Local Clone
- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
- Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
- To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3. $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
- Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
